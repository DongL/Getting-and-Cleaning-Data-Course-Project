## Data description
A group of 30 volunteers at ages ranging from 19 to 48 years old were enrolled in this video recorded experiment. Briefly, each individual was required to wear a Samsung Galaxy S II waist smartphone while performing six regular daily activities including WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING. At a constant rate of 50Hz, the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured by Samsung smartphones using the embedded the accelerometer and gyroscope. The data were then manually labeled and according to the video recorded during the experiment. The final datasets were generated by randomly partitioning 70% of the volunteers into the training group and 30% of the rest into the test group.
